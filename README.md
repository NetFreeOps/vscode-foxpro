## VSCode Syntax Highlighting and Snippets for Foxpro (VFP)

This extension adds generic syntax highlighting for foxpro (including function and class definition detection).

Snippets are customized to use some internal development tools. Just ignore those.

Changelog
1.3.0: Added configuration to ensure PRGs use Windows 1252 encoding

1.2.0: Syntax highlighting fix for asterisk (SELECT * FROM... no comments the rest of the line)

1.1.1: Expanded snippet definitions

1.1.0: Added snippets, cleaned up syntax file

1.0.1: Initial branch from original version

### For more information

The "master" branch contains snippets that reference internal development tools that you most likely aren't interested in. If that's the case, please feel free to clone the "vanilla" branch which should be free of any company-specific references.
